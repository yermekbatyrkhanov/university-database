# university_database

It is part of diploma project that i completed in June 2023.
Here i tried to create database where tables are connected in a right-way (foreign key). 
Such DLL statements as ALTER TABLE were used during the process as well as insertion. 
Constraint were included to maintain the integrity of database.
